# react-portfolio-project - The Office Quote 

Flatiron school rails portfolio project by Elena Hopkins

## Usage

This application is a rails API with a React front end. After cloning the repo, run bundle to install dependencies (from the project root). To migrate your local database, run rake db:migrate and rake db:seed.  Then cd to the client directory.  This directory contains the react app.  Run npm install from the client directory to install react dependencies.  To start the application, navigate to the project root and run 'rake start'.  (I am using foreman to start both the rails server and react app at the same time - take a look at the Procfile to see what processes are running)
